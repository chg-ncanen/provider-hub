# pde plugin

Plugin bundling the PDE team's JSM tooling, installable from any project — works with both
Claude Code and GitHub Copilot CLI, which both install from the same `.claude-plugin/` manifest.

## Contents

- **`mcp-servers/pde-mcp/`** — MCP server exposing JSM alert operations (`list_alerts`, `get_alert`,
  `acknowledge_alert`, `add_alert_note`, `close_alert`, `find_emails`, `send_email`) plus project
  skill discovery. Depends on the `pde-ops-api` library (`tools/team/pde/pde-ops-api` in this repo)
  via `requirements.txt` rather than bundling a copy — see that library's README.
- **`skills/resolve-duplicate-contact-alerts/`** — Skill that resolves duplicate-contact JSM alerts
  using the MCP server above plus `salesforce-prod`, a separate MCP server (the `@salesforce/mcp`
  npm package) not bundled here — see that skill's README for how to register it.
- **`skills/setup-companion-tools/`** — an opt-in skill (invoke it by asking to set up/connect
  companion tools) for installing Grafana, LogRocket, Atlassian, `salesforce-prod`, and LaunchDarkly
  one at a time. Deliberately *not* automatic (no `SessionStart` hook does this, and none of these —
  including LaunchDarkly, previously bundled directly — are actually called by any code in this
  plugin; only `salesforce-prod` is a genuine dependency, of `resolve-duplicate-contact-alerts`).
  Installing `pde` shouldn't silently pull in other teams'/vendors' plugins without you choosing to.

## Installing

```bash
# Claude Code
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/chg-ncanen/provider-hub.git
/plugin install pde@provider-hub

# Copilot CLI
copilot plugin marketplace add https://github.com/chg-ncanen/provider-hub.git
copilot plugin install pde@provider-hub
```

**Then start a new session** (close and reopen) — installing alone isn't enough. The dependency
setup below runs via a `SessionStart` hook, which only fires at an actual session boundary (new
session, `--resume`/`--continue`, `/clear`, or compaction); `/plugin install` and `/reload-plugins`
do *not* trigger it. Until that hook runs once, `pde-mcp` can't launch — its command points at a
venv that doesn't exist yet.

That hook (`scripts/bootstrap-deps.sh`) creates a venv under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.venv` and
installs `mcp-servers/pde-mcp/requirements.txt` into it, only reinstalling when that file changes.
It also best-effort installs the `sf` CLI (via `npm install -g @salesforce/cli`) if
`resolve-duplicate-contact-alerts` needs it and it's missing — but it can't authenticate `sf` for you
(that's an interactive browser login); it just tells you to run `sf org login web --alias prod` if
that alias isn't set up yet. It also never uses `sudo`: if the global npm prefix isn't writable, the
install just fails with a clear message pointing at the standard sudo-free fix (a user-owned npm
prefix), rather than hanging or silently doing nothing.

**Credentials** (`ATLASSIAN_EMAIL` / `ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN`, required; `EMAIL_USERNAME` /
`EMAIL_PASSWORD`, optional for `find_emails`):
- Claude Code prompts for these on first enable (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`'s `userConfig`) and the
  hook writes them to `mcp-servers/pde-mcp/.env`.
- Copilot CLI has no equivalent prompt — create that `.env` yourself (copy
  `mcp-servers/pde-mcp/.env.example`) after installing.
- **Rotating a credential later?** Run `/plugin configure pde@provider-hub` and restart the session
  as usual. The hook *unconditionally overwrites* `.env` from `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_*` whenever those
  are non-empty (no comparison against what's already there), so if Claude Code re-passes the updated
  value on the next session, it'll take automatically. Whether it actually does that (vs. only ever
  passing the value from first-configure) isn't documented, so if the old value still seems to be in
  effect after restarting: delete `mcp-servers/pde-mcp/.env` and restart again, or fully reinstall the
  plugin. Note this doesn't apply if you already export `ATLASSIAN_EMAIL`/`ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN`
  yourself — those take precedence over `.env` regardless (see `app.py`'s `load_dotenv()`).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+ on the machine running the CLI.
- For `resolve-duplicate-contact-alerts`: the `sf` CLI authenticated to the `prod` org alias
  (`npm install -g @salesforce/cli && sf org login web --alias prod`), and the `salesforce-prod`
  MCP server registered separately (see that skill's README).
